# Amplifier Foundation

Ultra-thin mechanism layer for bundle composition in the Amplifier ecosystem.

Foundation provides the mechanisms for loading, composing, and resolving bundles from local and remote sources. It sits between `amplifier-core` (kernel) and applications, enabling teams to share and compose AI agent configurations.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install amplifier-foundation
```

```python
import asyncio
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

async def main():
    # Load a bundle
    bundle = await load_bundle("./my-bundle")

    # Get mount plan for AmplifierSession
    mount_plan = bundle.to_mount_plan()
    print(f"Loaded: {bundle.name} v{bundle.version}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**For complete examples, see:**

- `examples/02_compose_bundles.py` - Bundle composition patterns
- `examples/03_execute_with_session.py` - Using bundles with AmplifierSession

## Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [CONCEPTS.md](docs/CONCEPTS.md) | Mental model: bundles, composition, mount plans |
| [PATTERNS.md](docs/PATTERNS.md) | Common patterns with code examples |
| [URI_FORMATS.md](docs/URI_FORMATS.md) | Source URI quick reference |
| [API_REFERENCE.md](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) | API index pointing to source files |

**Code is the authoritative reference**: Each source file has comprehensive docstrings. Read `bundle.py`, `validator.py`, etc. directly or use `help(ClassName)`.

## Philosophy

Foundation follows Amplifier's core principles:

- **Mechanism, not policy**: Provides loading/composition mechanisms. Apps decide which bundles to use.
- **Ruthless simplicity**: One concept (bundle), one mechanism (`includes:` + `compose()`).
- **Text-first**: YAML/Markdown formats are human-readable, diffable, versionable.
- **Composable**: Small bundles compose into larger configurations.

This library is pure mechanism. It doesn't know about specific bundles (even "foundation"). The co-located foundation bundle content is just content - discovered and loaded like any other bundle.
