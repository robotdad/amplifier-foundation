# Amplifier Foundation

Ultra-thin mechanism layer for bundle composition in the Amplifier ecosystem.

Foundation provides the mechanisms for loading, composing, and resolving bundles from local and remote sources. It sits between `amplifier-core` (kernel) and applications, enabling teams to share and compose AI agent configurations.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Install

```bash
pip install amplifier-foundation
```

### Load a Local Bundle

```python
import asyncio
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

async def main():
    # Load from local path
    bundle = await load_bundle("./my-bundle")

    # Get mount plan for AmplifierSession
    mount_plan = bundle.to_mount_plan()
    print(f"Loaded: {bundle.name} v{bundle.version}")
    print(f"Providers: {len(mount_plan.get('providers', []))}")
    print(f"Tools: {len(mount_plan.get('tools', []))}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Load from Git

```python
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

# Load bundle from GitHub
bundle = await load_bundle("git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main")

# Or with subdirectory
bundle = await load_bundle(
    "git+https://github.com/org/repo@main#subdirectory=bundles/my-bundle"
)
```

### Compose Bundles

```python
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

# Load base and overlay
base = await load_bundle("foundation")
overlay = await load_bundle("./my-customizations")

# Compose: overlay overrides base
composed = base.compose(overlay)
mount_plan = composed.to_mount_plan()
```

## What is a Bundle?

A **bundle** is a composable unit containing:

- **Mount plan config**: session, providers, tools, hooks
- **Resources**: agents, context files
- **Composition rules**: which bundles to include
- **Instructions**: system prompt for LLM guidance

Bundles produce mount plans for `AmplifierSession.create()`.

### Bundle Format

Bundles can be YAML (metadata only) or Markdown (metadata + instructions):

**bundle.yaml** - Configuration only:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: my-app
  version: 1.0.0
  description: My application bundle

includes:
  - foundation
  - foundation:behaviors/logging

session:
  orchestrator:
    module: loop-streaming
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-loop-streaming@main

providers:
  - module: provider-anthropic
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-provider-anthropic@main
    config:
      default_model: claude-sonnet-4-5

tools:
  - module: tool-filesystem
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-tool-filesystem@main
```

**bundle.md** - Configuration + instructions:

```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: dev-assistant
  version: 1.0.0

includes:
  - foundation
---

# Development Assistant

You are a development assistant. Follow best practices for code quality.

@foundation:context/IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY.md
```

The markdown body becomes the system instruction.

## Loading Bundles

### URI Patterns

Foundation supports multiple source types:

| Pattern | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Local path | `./my-bundle` | Directory or file |
| File URI | `file:///path/to/bundle` | Explicit file path |
| Git | `git+https://github.com/org/repo@main` | Git repository |
| Git subdirectory | `git+https://github.com/org/repo@v1.0#subdirectory=bundles/app` | Path within repo |
| Zip over HTTPS | `zip+https://example.com/bundles.zip#subdirectory=my-bundle` | Zip archive |
| Zip local | `zip+file:///archive.zip#subdirectory=path` | Local zip file |

### Resolution Priority

When loading by name, resolution follows this order:

1. **URIs**: `git+`, `http://`, `https://`, `file://` - resolve directly
2. **Local paths**: `./`, `../`, `~/`, `/` - filesystem lookup
3. **Bundle references**: `namespace:path` - lookup namespace, resolve path
4. **Plain names**: `foundation` - discovery lookup

### Customizing Resolution

```python
from amplifier_foundation import BundleResolver, SimpleSourceResolver, SimpleBundleDiscovery

# Create discovery and register known bundles
discovery = SimpleBundleDiscovery()
discovery.register("foundation", "git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main")
discovery.register("my-bundle", "file:///path/to/my-bundle")

# Create resolver with custom cache directory
resolver = BundleResolver(
    source_resolver=SimpleSourceResolver(
        cache_dir=Path("~/.my-app/cache").expanduser(),
        base_path=Path.cwd()
    ),
    discovery=discovery
)

bundle = await resolver.load("my-bundle")
```

## Composition

Bundles compose through the `includes:` directive (declarative) or `compose()` method (imperative).

### Declarative Composition

```yaml
# bundle.yaml
bundle:
  name: my-app

includes:
  - foundation                           # Base bundle
  - foundation:behaviors/logging         # Add logging behavior
  - foundation:providers/anthropic-sonnet  # Add provider
```

Includes are loaded in order. Later bundles override earlier ones.

### Imperative Composition

```python
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

base = await load_bundle("foundation")
logging = await load_bundle("foundation:behaviors/logging")
custom = await load_bundle("./my-customizations")

# Compose: later overrides earlier
result = base.compose(logging, custom)
```

### Composition Rules

| Section | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `session` | Deep merge (later overrides) |
| `providers`, `tools`, `hooks` | Merge by module ID |
| `agents`, `context` | Later overrides earlier |
| `instruction` | Later replaces earlier |

## The Foundation Bundle

This package includes a reference `foundation` bundle that provides:

- **Provider-agnostic base**: No providers (you add your choice)
- **Standard tools**: filesystem, bash, web, search, task
- **Behaviors**: logging, streaming-ui, redaction, status-context
- **Agents**: bug-hunter, explorer, zen-architect, modular-builder, etc.

### Using Foundation as Base

```python
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

# Load foundation as base
foundation = await load_bundle("foundation")

# Add your provider
my_bundle = await load_bundle("./my-config")
composed = foundation.compose(my_bundle)

# Your config can add providers without duplicating tools
```

Your `my-config/bundle.yaml`:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: my-config

providers:
  - module: provider-anthropic
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-provider-anthropic@main
    config:
      default_model: claude-sonnet-4-5
```

## Bundle Directory Structure

A typical bundle directory:

```
my-bundle/
  bundle.md           # Main bundle file (required)
  agents/             # Agent definitions
    code-reviewer.md
    tester.md
  context/            # Context files for @mentions
    PHILOSOPHY.md
    GUIDELINES.md
  behaviors/          # Sub-bundles for composable behaviors
    strict-mode/
      bundle.yaml
  providers/          # Provider configurations
    anthropic-opus/
      bundle.yaml
```

## API Reference

### Core Classes

#### Bundle

The composable unit containing configuration and resources.

```python
from amplifier_foundation import Bundle

# Create from dict
bundle = Bundle.from_dict({
    "bundle": {"name": "my-bundle", "version": "1.0.0"},
    "providers": [...],
    "tools": [...],
}, base_path=Path("./my-bundle"))

# Compose bundles
result = bundle.compose(other_bundle)

# Get mount plan
mount_plan = bundle.to_mount_plan()

# Resolve resources
agent_path = bundle.resolve_agent_path("bug-hunter")
context_path = bundle.resolve_context_path("PHILOSOPHY.md")
instruction = bundle.get_system_instruction()
```

#### BundleResolver

Loads and resolves bundles from various sources.

```python
from amplifier_foundation import BundleResolver

resolver = BundleResolver(
    source_resolver=...,  # Optional: custom source resolution
    discovery=...,        # Optional: custom bundle discovery
    cache=...,            # Optional: custom caching
)

# Load with automatic include resolution
bundle = await resolver.load("my-bundle", auto_include=True)

# Load without resolving includes
bundle = await resolver.load("my-bundle", auto_include=False)
```

#### load_bundle

Convenience function for simple loading.

```python
from amplifier_foundation import load_bundle

bundle = await load_bundle("git+https://github.com/org/repo@main")
```

### Protocols (Extension Points)

Foundation provides protocols for customization:

| Protocol | Purpose | Default Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `SourceResolverProtocol` | URI to local path | `SimpleSourceResolver` |
| `SourceHandlerProtocol` | Handle specific URI types | Git, HTTP, Zip, File handlers |
| `BundleDiscoveryProtocol` | Name to URI lookup | `SimpleBundleDiscovery` |
| `CacheProviderProtocol` | Bundle caching | `SimpleCache`, `DiskCache` |
| `MentionResolverProtocol` | @mention resolution | `BaseMentionResolver` |

### Utility Functions

```python
from amplifier_foundation import (
    # I/O
    read_yaml, write_yaml,
    parse_frontmatter,
    read_with_retry, write_with_retry,  # Cloud sync safe

    # Dicts
    deep_merge,
    merge_module_lists,
    get_nested, set_nested,

    # Paths
    parse_uri,
    normalize_path,

    find_bundle_root,

    # Mentions
    parse_mentions,
    load_mentions,

    # Validation
    validate_bundle,
    validate_bundle_or_raise,
)
```

### Exceptions

```python
from amplifier_foundation import (
    BundleError,           # Base exception
    BundleNotFoundError,   # Bundle not found
    BundleLoadError,       # Failed to load
    BundleValidationError, # Invalid bundle
    BundleDependencyError, # Circular dependency
)
```

## Philosophy

Foundation follows Amplifier's core principles:

- **Mechanism, not policy**: Provides loading/composition mechanisms. Apps decide which bundles to use.
- **Ruthless simplicity**: One concept (bundle), one mechanism (`includes:` + `compose()`).
- **Text-first**: YAML/Markdown formats are human-readable, diffable, versionable.
- **Composable**: Small bundles compose into larger configurations.

This library is pure mechanism. It doesn't know about specific bundles (even "foundation"). The co-located foundation bundle content is just content - discovered and loaded like any other bundle.
